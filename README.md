# Gaza-Damage-Density-Maps-2025
--------------------------------
The project visualizes the spatial distribution of building destruction across Gaza using UNOSAT data (2024–2025).  
The analysis was conducted in 'ArcGIS Pro' using the 'Kernel Density' tool to identify areas with destroyed, moderate, and severe damage intensity.  

Data Source: UNOSAT
Tool Used: ArcGIS Pro  
Output: JPEG map showing destruction density.
